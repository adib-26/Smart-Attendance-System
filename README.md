-Apply augmentation (rotation, brightness, cropping) for dataset diversity.

-Align and label faces using MTCNN.

-Model Development & Evaluation

-Generate embeddings using ArcFace.

-Train and test models under multiple configurations.

-Evaluate using metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, FAR, FRR.

-Web Application Deployment

-Integrate trained model into a Streamlit interface.

-Allow real-time photo upload and recognition.

-Save attendance logs and generate downloadable reports.




üìà Results (FYP I)
Metric	Value
Accuracy	77.27%
Precision	79.79%
Recall	77.27%
F1-Score	76.28%

Preliminary results indicate solid recognition performance with further improvements expected in FYP II through dataset expansion and optimization.
